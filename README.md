# OKA-SAN (Tentative) - AI-Integrated Study Support Desk Lamp

## Introduction
**OKA-SAN** is a smart desk lamp designed to assist students during their study sessions by encouraging good posture, providing breaks, and ensuring focus. It runs on a Raspberry Pi embedded within the product.

### Features

1. **Posture Correction**: OKA-SAN detects when the user is slouching or sitting with poor posture and provides gentle reminders through audio and light punches to encourage better posture.
2. **Wake-Up Alerts**: If the user falls asleep while studying, OKA-SAN will wake them up with sounds and light punches.
3. **Snack Delivery**: During breaks, OKA-SAN offers a small snack to keep the user energized.
4. **Auto On/Off Lighting**: OKA-SAN detects when the user approaches the desk and automatically turns on the light. When the user leaves, the light turns off.

## Installation

Since OKA-SAN runs on a pre-installed Raspberry Pi within the desk lamp, users do not need to manually install or configure the software. This repository is provided for reference only.

## How It Works

OKA-SAN uses a combination of sensors and cameras to monitor the userâ€™s posture and behavior. The software processes input from these sensors or cameras to determine when to activate specific features like posture correction, wake-up alerts, and automatic lighting.

1. **Posture Detection**: OKA-SAN detects the user's sitting position and assesses whether their posture is correct.
2. **Motion Sensors**: Detect when the user approaches or leaves the desk.
3. **Snack Dispenser Control**: A small motor system is used to deliver snacks during scheduled breaks.
4. **Wake-Up System**: The software triggers alarms and mild physical prompts when the user appears to be sleeping.
